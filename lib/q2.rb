# Challenge 2 - Reverse a string
# Reverse a string in place. In other words, do not create a new string or use other methods on the string such as reverse. The goal of the problem is to use a loop and the string accessors to figure out which values to swap for other values. Below is some sample output.
# Enter a string:
# reverse_me
# em_esrever
def reverse(str)
  arr = str.split ''
  new_arr = []
  arr.length.times { new_arr.push(arr.pop) }
  puts new_arr.join
end
reverse('apple')
